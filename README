	THEME: Tiny World


	The game idea.......... Platformer
	You play a drop of water that fell out of a bucket.. You're trying to reach the open water (sea or whatever) before you dry!
	
	You abilities are move left/right and jump...
	
	- Levels are horizontal
	- Levels have a timer (the dry time)
	- You die, you start at the beginning of the level
	
	
	
	---When time left---
	Create some sort of build mechanism so the levels can be a little harder...
